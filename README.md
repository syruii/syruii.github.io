#Homepage-v5-trystanr

This version of homepage-v5 has been modified by [@trystanr](https://github.com/Trystanr) to include a help for search bar commands. 

##IMPORTANT
Check out the script file in the JS directory. It's where you can setup your links, and change a few extra settings. Further explaination is provided in there.
By default the links are non-functioning, as the menus were setup to for a video demo.

Hey this is a fork of the original homepage with a few little twists of my own to increase user experience and add some meme animations (As well as removing some things).
